## 2.3.0 (2025-06-07)

### Features

#### Add `nomad` Certificates

Adds `nomad` as an experimental zero-config TLS Certificate provider for Sia hosts. `nomad` is run by the Sia Foundation to reduce friction of setting up a storage provider that supports WebTransport in browsers.

#### Add `nomad` automatic certificate generation

Optionally uses the Sia Foundation's `nomad` service to generate a `*.sia.host` TLS certificate to support the WebTransport protocol in browsers.

### Fixes

## 2.2.2 (2025-05-28)

### Fixes

- Use WindowEnd instead of WindowStart when checking if the renter attempts to form a contract too close to the v2 require height.

## 2.2.1 (2025-05-27)

### Fixes

- Fixed version update spam.

## 2.2.0 (2025-05-26)

### Features

- Added `[PUT] /api/system/connect/test` to trigger a test of the host's connectivity.
- Added periodic version checks.

#### Added periodic connection tests

Periodically tests the hosts connection using the SiaScan troubleshooting API. This provides alerts to hosts if for some reason their node is not connectable. This system relies on a central server for the test and may return occasional false positives. The server can be overridden by setting `Config.Explorer.URL`

#### Simplified V1 contract sectors management

Changes sector updates for V1 contracts to match the behavior from V2. The new behavior diffs the old and new sector roots and updates the changed indices in the database rather than relying on replaying the sector changes. This is slightly slower on large contracts due to needing to calculate the diff of each index, but it is significantly simpler and less prone to edge cases.

### Fixes

- Added volume and contract metrics to recalc command
- Fixed a panic in RHP2 sector roots RPC.
- Fixed consensus v2 commitment.
- Fixed a panic when encoding the alerts array during high frequency updates
- Locked wallet UTXOs will now be stored in the database.
- Updated core to v0.13.0 and coreutils to v0.15.0

## 2.1.0 (2025-04-29)

### Features

- The RHP4 port can now be set using the `-rhp4` flag.
- Added Prometheus support to `[GET] /syncer/peers`

#### Add endpoints for querying V2 contracts

Adds two new endpoints for querying V2 contracts

#### `[GET] /v2/contracts/:id`

Returns a single V2 contract by its ID

#### `[POST] /v2/contracts`

Queries a list of contracts with optional filtering

**Example request  body**
```json
{
  "statuses": [],
  "contractIDs": [],
  "renewedFrom": [],
  "renewedTo": [],
  "renterKey": [],
  "minNegotiationHeight": 0,
  "maxNegotiationHeight": 0,
  "minExpirationHeight": 0,
  "maxExpirationHeight": 0,
  "limit": 0,
  "offset": 0,
  "sortField": "",
  "sortDesc": false
}
```

#### Add QUIC support

Adds QUIC transport support in RHP4, enabling Sia network access through web browsers. This update also simplifies cross-language development by using a standard protocol.

#### Add support for RPCReplenish

Adds support RPCReplenish, simplifying management for renters with a large number of accounts.

### Fixes

- Fixed broken API client consensus methods
- Fix JSON field names for V2Contract type
- Fixed an issue with v2 contract sector roots not being reloaded
- Limit the number of parallel SQLite connections to 1 to prevent "database is locked" errors.
- Reduced migration time for large mostly empty volumes
- Update jape dependency to v0.13.0.
- Update module path to go.sia.tech/hostd/v2

## 2.0.4 (2025-02-24)

### Fixes

- Fix decoding error on RHP3 account id type
- Update core and coreutils dependencies to v0.10.1 and v0.11.1 respectively

## 2.0.3 (2025-02-07)

### Fixes

- Fix a potential panic when rpcLock fails
- Fixed a concurrency issue when migrating data from large volumes

#### Fixed an inconsistency migrating the config's log directory from the v1.1.2 config file

The deprecated `Log.Path` config field was a directory, while the new `Log.File.Path` is expected to be a file path. If the log directory was set, the log file path will be correctly migrated to `hostd.log` in the directory.

## 2.0.2 (2025-01-16)

### Fixes

- Add missing database index for migrated nodes
- Added "sqlite integrity" command
- Fixed an issue with contracts sometimes being rejected if one of their parent transactions was confirmed in an earlier block

## 2.0.1 (2025-01-13)

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue with alert content not showing in the UI

## 2.0.0 (2025-01-13)

### Breaking Changes

- Remove RHP Session endpoints
- Switched Docker base image from scratch to debian:bookworm-slim

#### Combined Mainnet and Testnet Binaries

This changes `hostd` to support multiple networks from a single binary. Instead of needing to download the Zen specific binary, users can switch networks through the YAML config or a CLI flag: `--network=zen`.

This does have some broader implications. The environment variables and default ports have also been combined. Users running both Mainnet and Zen nodes will need to manually change ports in their config files.

##### Removed Environment Variables
- `HOSTD_ZEN_SEED` -> `HOSTD_WALLET_SEED`
- `HOSTD_ZEN_API_PASSWORD` -> `HOSTD_API_PASSWORD`
- `HOSTD_ZEN_LOG_PATH` -> `HOSTD_LOG_FILE_PATH`

#### Renamed Environment Variables

Some of the environment variable names have been renamed for better consistency between `renterd`, `walletd`, and `hostd`. If your install was using environment variables for configuration, they may need to be updated. The preferred way to configure `hostd` is a YAML config file.

- `HOSTD_SEED` -> `HOSTD_WALLET_SEED`
- `HOSTD_LOG_FILE` -> `HOSTD_LOG_FILE_PATH`

#### Support V2 Hardfork

The V2 hardfork is scheduled to modernize Sia's consensus protocol, which has been untouched since Sia's mainnet launch back in 2014, and improve accessibility of the storage network. To ensure a smooth transition from V1, it will be executed in two phases. Additional documentation on upgrading will be released in the near future.

##### V2 Highlights
- Drastically reduces blockchain size on disk
- Improves UTXO spend policies - including HTLC support for Atomic Swaps
- More efficient contract renewals - reducing lock up requirements for hosts and renters
- Improved transfer speeds - enables hot storage

##### Phase 1 - Allow Height
- **Activation Height:** `513400` (March 10th, 2025)
- **New Features:** V2 transactions, contracts, and RHP4
- **V1 Support:** Both V1 and V2 will be supported during this phase
- **Purpose:** This period gives time for integrators to transition from V1 to V2
- **Requirements:** Users will need to update to support the hardfork before this block height

##### Phase 2 - Require Height
- **Activation Height:** `526000` (June 6th, 2025)
- **New Features:** The consensus database can be trimmed to only store the Merkle proofs
- **V1 Support:** V1 will be disabled, including RHP2 and RHP3. Only V2 transactions will be accepted
- **Requirements:** Developers will need to update their apps to support V2 transactions and RHP4 before this block height

#### Switch to `core` consensus

Removes the last legacy code from `siad`. Switching between Mainnet and Testnet can now be done with a CLI flag e.g. `--network=zen`. This will require hosts to resync the blockchain. Refrain from upgrading if contracts are about to expire.

#### Use standard locations for application data

Uses standard locations for application data instead of the current directory. This brings `hostd` in line with other system services and makes it easier to manage application data.

##### Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD
- Configuration: `/etc/hostd/hostd.yml`
- Data directory: `/var/lib/hostd`

##### macOS
- Configuration: `~/Library/Application Support/hostd.yml`
- Data directory: `~/Library/Application Support/hostd`

##### Windows
- Configuration: `%APPDATA%\SiaFoundation\hostd.yml`
- Data directory: `%APPDATA%\SiaFoundation\hostd`

##### Docker
- Configuration: `/data/hostd.yml`
- Data directory: `/data`

### Features

- Attempt to upgrade existing configs instead of exiting

#### Add RHP4 support

RHP4 is the next generation of renter-host protocol for the Sia storage network. It dramatically increases performance compared to RHP3, improves contract payouts, reduces collateral lockup, and enables features necessary for light clients. The new protocol will be available and activated starting at block height `513400` (March 10th, 2025).

#### Refactor Sector Management

Improves sector lookups by 50% on average by removing the sector lock tables and moving reference pruning out of the hot path.

### Fixes

- Automate changelog generation
- Fixed a major speed regression when uploading data on larger nodes
- Fixed a panic updating metrics when a contract formation is reverted
- Fixed an issue with price pinning not updating prices
- Move RHP2 and RHP3 settings into the config manager to be consistent with RHP4
- The default number of registry entries is now 0. The registry is deprecated and will not be supported after the V2 hardfork.
