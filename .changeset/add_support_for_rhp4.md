# Add RHP4 support

RHP4 is the next generation of renter-host protocol for the Sia storage network. It dramatically increases performance compared to RHP3, improves contract payouts, reduces collateral lockup, and enables features necessary for light clients. The new protocol will be available and activated starting at block height `513400` (March 10th, 2025).
